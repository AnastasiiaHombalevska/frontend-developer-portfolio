          <p className="about--introduction">I'm an experienced front-end developer with a psychology background looking to improve my technical skills. I have a good knowledge of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Sass (SCSS), and have gained hands-on experience with React, TypeScript, and Git/GitHub while developing educational projects. Now I'm looking to take on real-world challenges in front-end development and make my mark in the industry. I have a fundamental knowledge of object-oriented programming and am familiar with software development methodologies such as Agile. I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and development, and I am ready to delve into any necessary areas.
